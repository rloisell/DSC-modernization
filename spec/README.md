# Spec placeholder

The Spec Kit subtree import was attempted but the upstream repository URL
(`https://github.com/microsoft/spec-kit.git`) was not found.

Options:

- Provide the correct upstream Git URL and the assistant will import it as a git subtree at `spec/spec-kit`.
- Alternatively, instruct the assistant to vendor/copy the Spec Kit files into `spec/` now.

For now this placeholder documents the intent and subtree policy in `spec/SUBTREE_POLICY.md`.
