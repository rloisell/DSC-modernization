# Work Package Prompt: WP04 – Frontend — /myteam route and MyTeam.jsx page

## Files to Create/Modify

- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/pages/MyTeam.jsx` (new)
- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/hooks/useMyTeam.js` (new)
- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/App.jsx`
- Sidebar component

## Steps

1. `useMyTeam()` hook: fetch calling user's `departmentId` from user query, then fetch
   `GET /api/departments/{deptId}/members`.
2. `MyTeam.jsx`:
   - Department name as heading
   - Manager card (name, role)
   - Teammate list (name, position, active status)
   - Graceful empty state if no teammates
3. Add `/myteam` route in `App.jsx`.
4. Add "My Team" nav link to sidebar.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `/myteam` renders for a seeded User
- [ ] Department name, manager, teammates shown
- [ ] Nav link visible in sidebar
