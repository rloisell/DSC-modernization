Date: 2026-02-18

Repository bootstrap created by assistant.

Actions:
- Created repository scaffold: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`.
- Added this `AI` folder to track progress and decisions for the modernization effort.

Next steps:
- Initialize the repository, push to GitHub under `rloisell/DSC-modernization`.
- Integrate the Spec Kit and scaffold .NET solution.

Repository creation:

- 2026-02-18: Repository `rloisell/DSC-modernization` created on GitHub and initial scaffold pushed by assistant.

Remote: https://github.com/rloisell/DSC-modernization

Spec Kit integration (attempt):

- 2026-02-18: Attempted to add Spec Kit as a git subtree under `spec/spec-kit` from `https://github.com/microsoft/spec-kit.git`, but the upstream repository was not found. A local placeholder `spec/README.md` has been added; please provide the correct upstream repo URL if you want the subtree imported, or confirm that we should vendor the Spec Kit contents instead.
