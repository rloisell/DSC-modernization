# Work Package Prompt: WP03 – Frontend — populate Team Reports tab in Reports.jsx

## Context

Replace the Team Reports placeholder (from feature 005) with actual data tables.

## Files to Modify

- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/pages/Reports.jsx`
- New hooks: `useProjectEffortSummary.js`, `useActivityAreaDeviation.js`

## Steps

1. Create two TanStack Query hooks.
2. In the Team Reports tab section:
   - Render `ProjectEffortSummaryTable` with columns: Project No, Name, Estimated, Planned, Actual, Est vs Act %, Plan vs Act %
   - Render `ActivityAreaDeviationTable` with columns: Activity Code, Description, Planned, Actual, Deviation, Deviation %
3. Handle role-gate: only render tables if user role is Manager/Director/Admin
   (backend also enforces — this is a UX guard only).

## Acceptance

- [ ] Both tables render in Team Reports tab
- [ ] User role sees permission message, not tables
- [ ] Correct column headers and data
