# Work Package Prompt: WP05 – Frontend — OrgChart.jsx component in Administrator.jsx

## Files to Create/Modify

- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/components/OrgChart.jsx` (new)
- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/pages/Administrator.jsx`

## Steps

1. `OrgChart.jsx`:
   - Fetch `GET /api/org-chart`
   - Render department cards: dept name + manager + member count
   - Expand/collapse: click card to show full member roster
   - "Export" placeholder button (no-op for now, enabled in a future iteration)
2. Add "Team" tab to `Administrator.jsx` `<TabBar />` (8th tab).
3. Render `<OrgChart />` when Team tab is active.

## Acceptance

- [ ] All departments shown as cards
- [ ] Click to expand shows member roster
- [ ] Tab added to Administrator without breaking existing 7 tabs
