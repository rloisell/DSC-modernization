# Work Package Prompt: WP02 – Wire Task Deviation tab to feature 003 API

## Context

Connect the Task Deviation tab to the API endpoint from feature 003.

## Note

If feature 003 branch is not yet merged into develop, import the hook by
branching from `feature/task-deviation-report` instead of `develop`.

## Steps

1. Import `useTaskDeviationReport` hook.
2. In Task Deviation tab content: render the colour-coded table.
3. Add date range filter controls.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Task Deviation tab shows data from API
- [ ] Colour coding is correct
- [ ] Filters work
