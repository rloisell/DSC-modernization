# Work Package Prompt: WP02 – WeeklySummary.jsx — page component with three sections

## Context

Create the Weekly Summary page.

## Files to Create/Modify

- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/pages/WeeklySummary.jsx` (new)
- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/App.jsx`
- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (or equivalent nav component)

## Steps

1. Create `WeeklySummary.jsx`:
   - TanStack Query: fetch `GET /api/items?timePeriod=week` + user's project assignments
   - Section 1: group items by project; show date, description, planned/actual hours per item
   - Section 2: for each active project, fetch remaining hours and render progress bar
     - `width: ${(actual/estimated)*100}%` capped at 100%; red if over
     - OVERBUDGET label when actual > estimated
   - Section 3: `<h3>Outstanding Tasks</h3>` + placeholder text ("Coming soon")
   - Empty state: "Nothing logged this week yet." if items array is empty
2. Add `<Route path="/weekly" element={<WeeklySummary />} />` to `App.jsx`.
3. Add "My Week" nav link to sidebar.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `/weekly` renders without errors
- [ ] Activities grouped by project with totals
- [ ] Progress bars correct, OVERBUDGET highlighted red
- [ ] Nav link active when on `/weekly`
