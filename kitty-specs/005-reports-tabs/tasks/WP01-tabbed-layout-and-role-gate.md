# Work Package Prompt: WP01 – Reports.jsx — three-tab layout with role-gated Team Reports

## Context

Restructure the Reports page into three tabs. Team Reports is role-gated.

## Files to Modify

- `src/DSC.WebClient/src/pages/Reports.jsx`

## Steps

1. Import `<TabBar />` from `src/components/TabBar.jsx`.
2. Add `activeTab` state — default `'my-summary'`.
3. Define tabs array; render `<TabBar />`.
4. Wrap existing My Summary content in `activeTab === 'my-summary'` guard.
5. Team Reports tab: check user role from auth context:
   - `User` → render `<p>Insufficient permissions...</p>`
   - Others → render `<TeamReportsPlaceholder />` (simple "Coming in a future update" until 007 is merged)

## Acceptance

- [ ] Three tabs visible on Reports page
- [ ] My Summary content unchanged
- [ ] Team Reports tab shows correct content per role
- [ ] No console errors
